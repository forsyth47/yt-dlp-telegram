   #Windows
   idk, you should not be using wind*ws in the first place for development
   ```
   Setting up project:
   ```bash
   python3.12 -m venv .venv
   # Note: python3.14 are known to have some issues, so use python version of somewhere between 9-13
   source ./.venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   # Completely Optional: Install aria2 for experimental downloads (not recommened, unless for devs)
   # brew install aria2  # macOS
   # sudo apt install aria2  # Linux
   ```

3. **Configuration**
   Edit `config.py` with your Telegram API credentials:
   ```python
   token = "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN"
   api_id = 123456
   api_hash = "your_api_hash"
   ```
   Optional:
   ```
   Sending logs to a channel, enter the channel id
   logs = -1234567890
   ```

4. **Run the bot**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

<!-- ---
How it works:
downloads -> instead of uploading create webserver -> expose the tmp dir to public -> pass the public url to telegram -> uploads instantly -->
